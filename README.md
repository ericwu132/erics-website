# erics-website
This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. It’s a place where I share my projects, design work, and experiences in engineering, robotics, and software.

The site was designed in Figma and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focused on keeping the layout clean, responsive, and easy to navigate across different screen sizes. I update the site as I work on new projects or improve my skills.
